# Vision-Language Models

Some samples for using vision-language models with Hugging Face's inference API 
and Python inference client.

Vision-language models present the text generation capabilities of large language 
models combined with image data. This enables completion chats to take images
as inputs and for prompts to refer to those images.


## Prerequisites

A working Python installation and follow the instructions in the root-level README
to install the repo's required packages. Enable the virtual environment.
